# municipal-ordinance-builder
Beta build of a static interface for municipalities to host their zoning ordinance.

## Getting started

### Install dependencies
Install Ruby gems with Bundler:

```bash
bundle install
```

### Run the local server
Start a live Jekyll server for development:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

### Customize your municipality
Edit `_data/municipality.yml` to configure your site's settings (name, base URL,
logo path and navigation links). Replace the placeholder values with details for
your municipality.
